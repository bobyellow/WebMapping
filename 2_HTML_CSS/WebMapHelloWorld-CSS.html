    <p>
      Welcome to the University of South Florida. Though a relatively young university, founded in 1956, we have rich traditions – traditions of access and opportunity for students, of academic excellence, of groundbreaking research, of serving our communities.
    </p>
    <p>
      USF is situated in the vibrant and diverse Tampa Bay region, with campuses in Tampa, St. Petersburg and Sarasota-Manatee. Together, our campuses serve more than 50,000 students pursuing undergraduate, graduate, specialist and professional degrees. Across our 13 colleges, undergraduates choose from more than 200 majors, minors and concentrations, from business and engineering to the arts and USF Health.

    <!-- step 1b: add a short description from https://www.usf.edu/arts-sciences/departments/geosciences/about/index.aspx -->
    <p>
    The School of Geosciences was formed through the merger of three degree-granting programs: Geology, Environmental Science & Policy, and Geography. Geology and Environmental Science & Policy programs are commonly linked, at other Florida SUS institutions (e.g., Florida State University’s Department of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Studies; College of Arts and Sciences) and other AAU institutions (e.g., the University of Pittsburg’s Department of Geology and Environmental Science; College of Arts and Sciences). Our innovation was to add the Geography program, uniquely adding both the human element of the environment and the geospatial science and technology elements common to all three disciplines. Starting with this innovative model, the School of Geosciences has steadily built toward a common vision, sharing faculty, staff, students, curricula, and facilities and resources, creating and graduating students uniquely qualified to address the complex socioenvironmental problems common to our modern world.

    The mascot of USF is Rocky the Bull. Click to know more about <a href="https://www.usf.edu/about-usf/rocky.aspx"> Rocky</a>.<br>
    Rocky the Bull got his start as a toy idea for the USF Bookstore in 1965. The first Rocky was drawn as a cartoon rendition for USF Athletics to use in their newsletters.
